# WebSocket Gateway Token Extraction Issue â€” Investigation Report

## 1. Initial Setup
- **Goal:** Create a simple NestJS WebSocket gateway (`/test` namespace) to test basic socket connections.
- **Result:** Successfully connected to the gateway; connection and disconnection events were logged as expected.

## 2. Introducing Token Extraction
- **Change:** Modified the gateway to extract a `token` from either the query parameter (`client.handshake.query.token`) or the `Authorization` header (`client.handshake.headers.authorization`), and log it.
- **Result:** After this change, socket connection requests started hanging (no connection established, no logs).

## 3. Incremental Debugging Steps
- **Step 1:** Isolated token extraction to only the query parameter.
  - **Action:** Commented out header extraction; only used `client.handshake.query.token`.
  - **Result:** Connection still hung; no improvement.
- **Step 2:** Isolated token extraction to only the `Authorization` header.
  - **Action:** Commented out query extraction; only used `client.handshake.headers.authorization`.
  - **Result:** Connection still hung; no improvement.

## 4. Current Status
- **Observation:** The gateway works when no token extraction is performed, but hangs as soon as any attempt is made to access `client.handshake.query` or `client.handshake.headers.authorization` during `handleConnection`.

## Analysis & Hypotheses

### Why is this not working?
- **Socket.IO Client Differences:** Depending on the client and how it connects, the `handshake.query` and `handshake.headers` objects may not be populated as expected.
- **Version Mismatch:** There may be a version mismatch between the Socket.IO server (used by NestJS) and the client, especially regarding how query parameters and headers are sent and parsed.
- **CORS or Transport Issues:** If the client is not sending the expected headers or query parameters due to CORS, proxy, or transport settings, the server may not receive them, leading to unexpected behavior.
- **Synchronous/Async Issues:** If the `handleConnection` method throws an error or hangs while accessing these properties, it could prevent the connection from being established.
- **NestJS/Socket.IO Bug:** There could be a bug or undocumented behavior in the integration between NestJS and Socket.IO regarding handshake property access.

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Log the Entire Handshake Object:**  
   Before extracting the token, log `client.handshake` to see what properties are actually present at connection time.
2. **Check Client Implementation:**  
   Ensure the client is actually sending the query parameter or header as expected. Use browser dev tools or a tool like [wscat](https://github.com/websockets/wscat) to inspect the handshake.
3. **Check Socket.IO Versions:**  
   Make sure the versions of Socket.IO on the server and client are compatible.
4. **Error Handling:**  
   Wrap the extraction logic in a try-catch block and log any errors to avoid silent failures.
5. **Minimal Reproduction:**  
   Try a minimal Socket.IO server (outside of NestJS) to see if the issue persists, which can help isolate whether the problem is with NestJS or Socket.IO itself.
